Issues we planned to address:
- Making the base framework of the website
Successfully made a very basic application complete with multiple pages, and a navigation bar to route to them
- General lack of experience
As none of us had a strong background in JavaScript and application design, we made the decision
to create two versions of a basic front-end application amongst the front-end team. 
- Lack of backend
Since we do not have a functioning backend, we implemented a json-server that feeds data to 
the application from a single .db file.
- REST API
Basic functions such as json are unable to work. A layout of a simple REST API was created but is unable to run due to import errors.
