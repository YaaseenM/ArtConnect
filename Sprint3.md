Work completed for Sprint 3:

Frontend Work: Cleaned up the home page and modified the signup and login methods to properly talk to the api, added a post method to the profile component for making text posts to the page through GET and POST on the api, added ui for uploading files but still working on functionality between frontend and backend. 
Front-end test cases: 
Gets, Types and asserts: Tests to see if the page runs, tests to see if navigation bar is displaying properly
Routes: Tests to see if routing is working properly, checks url to make sure it is correct, also tests routing through the navbar dropdown
Signup/Login works: Tests to see if routing to signup works, enters mock values for signup page, and runs the signup method to see if it properly posts to the api. Then routes to the login page and tests the login method to make sure it properly gets values from the api to check if the user exists. Also checks to see if login properly routes when the method is successful
Profile posting through api and through text field: Tests to see if the post and get methods works through the profile page
Also added mounting for most components for component testing

Back-end test cases:
